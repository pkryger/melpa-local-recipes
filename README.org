#+title: MELPA recipes to build from a local checkouts

This is to let package-build to work with local clones of packages. Note, that
each file in =recipes/= directory needs to be in sync with its counterpart in
MELPA (except for =:fetcher= and =:url= / =:repo=)

Sample configuration:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package package-build
  :config
  (when-let* ((dir "~/gh/pkryger/melpa-local-recipes")
              ((file-directory-p dir)))
    (setopt package-build-working-dir (expand-file-name "working/" dir))
    (setopt package-build-archive-dir (expand-file-name "packages/" dir))
    (setopt package-build-recipes-dir (expand-file-name "recipes/" dir))))
#+end_src
